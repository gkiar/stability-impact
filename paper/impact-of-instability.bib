  abstract = "Diffusion-weighted imaging coupled with tractography is currently
              the only method for in vivo mapping of human white-matter
              fascicles. Tractography takes diffusion measurements as input and
              produces the connectome, a large collection of white-matter
              fascicles, as output. We introduce a method to evaluate the
              evidence supporting connectomes. Linear fascicle evaluation
              (LiFE) takes any connectome as input and predicts diffusion
              measurements as output, using the difference between the measured
              and predicted diffusion signals to quantify the prediction error.
              We use the prediction error to evaluate the evidence that
              supports the properties of the connectome, to compare
              tractography algorithms and to test hypotheses about tracts and

              brain images. To manually label the macroscopic anatomy in
              magnetic resonance images of 101 healthy participants, we created
              a new cortical labeling protocol that relies on robust anatomical
              landmarks and minimal manual edits after initialization with
              automated labels. The ``Desikan-Killiany-Tourville'' (DKT)
              protocol is intended to improve the ease, consistency, and
              accuracy of labeling human cortical areas. Given how difficult it

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Alterations in the hedonic component of ingestive
              behaviors have been implicated as a possible risk factor in the
              pathophysiology of overweight and obese individuals. Neuroimaging
              evidence from individuals with increasing body mass index
              suggests structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in
              the extended reward network and associated networks. AIM: To
              apply a multivariate pattern analysis to distinguish normal
              weight and overweight subjects based on gray and white-matter
              measurements. METHODS: Structural images (N = 120, overweight N =
              63) and diffusion tensor images (DTI) (N = 60, overweight N = 30)
              were obtained from healthy control subjects. For the total sample
              the mean age for the overweight group (females = 32, males = 31)
              was 28.77 years (SD = 9.76) and for the normal weight group
              (females = 32, males = 25) was 27.13 years (SD = 9.62). Regional
              segmentation and parcellation of the brain images was performed
              using Freesurfer. Deterministic tractography was performed to
              measure the normalized fiber density between regions. A
              multivariate pattern analysis approach was used to examine
              whether brain measures can distinguish overweight from normal
              weight individuals. RESULTS: 1. White-matter classification: The
              classification algorithm, based on 2 signatures with 17 regional
              connections, achieved 97\% accuracy in discriminating overweight
              individuals from normal weight individuals. For both brain
              signatures, greater connectivity as indexed by increased fiber
              density was observed in overweight compared to normal weight
              between the reward network regions and regions of the executive
              control, emotional arousal, and somatosensory networks. In
              contrast, the opposite pattern (decreased fiber density) was
              found between ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior
              insula, and between thalamus and executive control network
              regions. 2. Gray-matter classification: The classification
              algorithm, based on 2 signatures with 42 morphological features,
              achieved 69\% accuracy in discriminating overweight from normal
              weight. In both brain signatures regions of the reward, salience,
              executive control and emotional arousal networks were associated
              with lower morphological values in overweight individuals
              compared to normal weight individuals, while the opposite pattern
              was seen for regions of the somatosensory network. CONCLUSIONS:
              1. An increased BMI (i.e., overweight subjects) is associated
              with distinct changes in gray-matter and fiber density of the
              brain. 2. Classification algorithms based on white-matter
              connectivity involving regions of the reward and associated
              networks can identify specific targets for mechanistic studies
              and future drug development aimed at abnormal ingestive behavior
              and in overweight/obesity.",

              large cohort of subjects. The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ
              in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners
              and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We
              describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural,
              functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to
              accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial
              artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal
              registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines
              are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data
              offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a
              recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated

  abstract = "Magnetic resonance imaging has become an indispensable tool for
              studying associations of structural and functional properties of
              the brain with behavior in humans. However, generally recognized
              standards for assessing and reporting the reliability of these
              techniques are still lacking. Here, we introduce a new approach
              for assessing and reporting reliability, termed intra-class
              effect decomposition (ICED). ICED uses structural equation
              modeling of data from a repeated-measures design to decompose
              reliability into orthogonal sources of measurement error that are
              associated with different characteristics of the measurements,
              for example, session, day, or scanning site. This allows
              researchers to describe the magnitude of different error
              components, make inferences about error sources, and inform them
              in planning future studies. We apply ICED to published
              measurements of myelin content and resting state functional
              connectivity. These examples illustrate how longitudinal data can
              be leveraged separately or conjointly with cross-sectional data
              to obtain more precise estimates of reliability.",

              depending on the computing platform where they are compiled and
              executed. We quantify these differences for brain tissue
              classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness (CT)
              extraction, using three of the main neuroimaging packages (FSL,
              Freesurfer and CIVET) and different versions of GNU/Linux. We
              also identify some causes of these differences using library and
              system call interception. We find that these packages use
              mathematical functions based on single-precision floating-point
              arithmetic whose implementations in operating systems continue to
              evolve. While these differences have little or no impact on
              simple analysis pipelines such as brain extraction and cortical
              tissue classification, their accumulation creates important
              differences in longer pipelines such as subcortical tissue
              classification, fMRI analysis, and cortical thickness extraction.
              With FSL, most Dice coefficients between subcortical
              classifications obtained on different operating systems remain
              above 0.9, but values as low as 0.59 are observed. Independent
              component analyses (ICA) of fMRI data differ between operating
              systems in one third of the tested subjects, due to differences
              in motion correction. With Freesurfer and CIVET, in some brain
              regions we find an effect of build or operating system on
              cortical thickness. A first step to correct these reproducibility
              issues would be to use more precise representations of
              floating-point numbers in the critical sections of the pipelines.
              The numerical stability of pipelines should also be reviewed.",

                   Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) process.
                   Stochastic Arithmetic is one way to model and estimate FP
                   losses of accuracy, which scales well to large, industrial
                   codes. It exists in different flavors, such as CESTAC or
                   MCA, implemented in various tools such as CADNA, Verificarlo
                   or Verrou. These methodologies and tools are based on the
                   idea that FP losses of accuracy can be modeled via
                   randomness. Therefore, they share the same need to perform a
                   statistical analysis of programs results in order to
                   estimate the significance of the results. In this paper, we
                   propose a framework to perform a solid statistical analysis
                   of Stochastic Arithmetic. This framework unifies all
                   existing definitions of the number of significant digits
                   (CESTAC and MCA), and also proposes a new quantity of
                   interest: the number of digits contributing to the accuracy
                   of the results. Sound confidence intervals are provided for
                   all estimators, both in the case of normally distributed
                   results, and in the general case. The use of this framework
                   is demonstrated by two case studies of large, industrial
                   codes: Europlexus and code\textbackslash\_aster.",

              phenotypic characterization, state-of-the-art neuroimaging, and
              genetic samples must be generated and made openly available to
              the scientific community. The enhanced Nathan Kline
              Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is a response to this need.
              NKI-RS is an ongoing, institutionally centered endeavor aimed at
              creating a large-scale (N > 1000), deeply phenotyped,
              community-ascertained, lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years old) with
              advanced neuroimaging and genetics. These data will be publically
              shared, openly, and prospectively (i.e., on a weekly basis).

              study design, sampling considerations, and steps to synchronize

              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.

  abstract = "Obesity is a medical condition affecting billions of people.
              Various neuroimaging methods including magnetic resonance imaging
              (MRI) have been used to obtain information about obesity. We
              adopted a multi-modal approach combining diffusion tensor imaging
              (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to incorporate
              complementary information and thus better investigate the brains
              of non-healthy weight subjects. The objective of this study was
              to explore multi-modal neuroimaging and use it to predict a
              practical clinical score, body mass index (BMI). Connectivity
              analysis was applied to DTI and rs-fMRI. Significant regions and
              associated imaging features were identified based on group-wise
              differences between healthy weight and non-healthy weight
              subjects. Six DTI-driven connections and 10 rs-fMRI-driven
              connectivities were identified. DTI-driven connections better
              reflected group-wise differences than did rs-fMRI-driven
              connectivity. We predicted BMI values using multi-modal imaging
              features in a partial least-square regression framework (percent
              error 15.0\%). Our study identified brain regions and imaging
              features that can adequately explain BMI. We identified
              potentially good imaging biomarker candidates for obesity-related
              diseases.",

              using regional gray matter volume, as well as to investigate
              changes in small-world and modular organization with normal
              aging. We constructed structural brain networks composed of 90
              regions in young, middle, and old age groups. We randomly
              selected 350 healthy subjects for each group from a Japanese
              magnetic resonance image database. Structural brain networks in
              three age groups showed economical small-world properties,
              providing high global and local efficiency for parallel
              information processing at low connection cost. The small-world
              efficiency and node betweenness varied significantly and revealed
              a U- or inverted U-curve model tendency among three age groups.
              Results also demonstrated that structural brain networks
              exhibited a modular organization in which the connections between
              regions are much denser within modules than between them. The
              modular organization of structural brain networks was similar
              between the young and middle age groups, but quite different from
              the old group. In particular, the old group showed a notable
              decrease in the connector ratio and the intermodule connections.
              Combining the results of small-world efficiency, node betweenness
              and modular organization, we concluded that the brain network
              changed slightly, developing into a more distributed organization
              from young to middle age. The organization eventually altered
              greatly, shifting to a more localized organization in old age.
              Our findings provided quantitative insights into topological
              principles of structural brain networks and changes related to
              normal aging.",
