    "For each experiment summarized below, a table accompanies the stated hypothesis which describes the dataset(s) used to test the hypothesis. In each column, 'All' indicates that the comparison is made along the specified variable, a '1' indicates a setting in which the test is performed multiple times using a single value of this variable for each test, and 'Ref' refers to using the single reference execution. A value of 'Indep.' refers to tests which are performed for each single value independently, and 'Indep. & Compare' refers to variables for which a two-sample test comparing each value of this variable will be performed following independent evaluation. To avoid false-positive inflation due to multiple comparisons, the mean and standard deviation statistic and p-value for each test will be reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, following this structure, 9 tests will be performed for each of two pipelines and two perturbation modes, resulting in 36 one-sample tests. For each of these 9 tests, 2 two-sample tests will be performed, comparing pipelines for each perturbation mode, resulting in an additional 18 tests, bringing the total number of tests to 54.\n",
